PlayDog is a 'Make It Yourself', interactive game for dogs -- [check out a video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9UyuIkXfJs).

It's an experimental product, built of 3D printed parts & off the shelf electronics.
You make it entirely on your own and control it via a [dedicated PlayDog App](http://roboplan.github.io/Playdog).

Based on principals of operational conditioning, PlayDog uses sound and food coupling,
teaching your dog to act on a melody as it would grant it an edible reward. 
It's built of multiple bases positioned in your home, and it plans random 
running laps from base to base, ending at the feeding base - where, after 
a successful lap, your pet receives a tasty snack.

* PlayDog is a game with a learning curve - be patient with your pet. Training may take a few days to a few weeks.
* PlayDog was designed for one dog and may not be suitable for more than one dog simultaneously.
* Leave your dog alone to play only when you've seen that your dog interacts with it safely.
